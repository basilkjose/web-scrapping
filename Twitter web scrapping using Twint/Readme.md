## [Twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint)

Twint is an advanced tool for Twitter scrapping. We can use this tool to scrape any user’s followers, following, tweets, etc. without having to use Twitter API.
Here are some of the benefits

  * Twitter API has restrictions to scrape only the last 3200 Tweets. But Twint can fetch almost all Tweets.
  * Set up is really quick as there is no hassle of setting up Twitter API.
  * Can be used anonymously without Twitter sign-up.
  * It’s free!! No pricing limitations.
  * Provides easy to use options to store scraped tweets into different formats — CSV, JSON, SQLite, and Elasticsearch.
